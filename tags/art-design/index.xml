      <description>Above you can see a perfect pancake flip. At the end of our QEA II class, my project, with Olivia Jo Bradley, was centered around measuring the accelerations and orientations of the pan so that we can compare these (and the frequencies of the accelerations) to a perfect pancake flip, and create animations like the one below. If you want to know how we go from the gif above and the data collected from that movement to the animation below go to our project website.</description>

      <description>For the final project for our Software Design class, Oscar De La Garza and I decided to create an Adventure Game in the style of the original The Legend Of Zelda. We created this game using Python&amp;rsquo;s PyGame library, developing different enemies, characters, screens, and mechanics that are used on different goals throughout the game. You can see in more detail the Sprites and mechanics we developed for Medieval Quest in our project webpage below.</description>
