      <description>Elliptic Curve Cryptography is one of the most common forms of cryptography used in messaging services and different internet transactions and information exchanges. For our final project in Discrete Math, Jack Greenberg, Oscar De La Garza, and I decided that we were going to create a webpage with a set of slides that helps people understand the basic of what ECC is, how, and why it works. The website can be seen in the link below.</description>
