      <title>CPU Components in Minecraft: 8-bit ALU</title>

      <description>Throughout the semester in out Computer Architecture class, we learned how different logic gates are used to create different components of a CPU, eventually leading up to us building a full Single-Cycle CPU (which you can see in another project). For our final project, Oscar De La Garza and I decided to recreate one of these very important components from a CPU in a different platform than the ones we had used previously: Minecraft.</description>

      <description>Throughout the semester of Computer Architecture we started with Binary logic and built our knowledge up all the way to how different components of a CPU are built from logic gates. This last Lab was centered around me and Oscar De La Garza creating a Single Cycle CPU in Verilog. We built the CPU with branches, jumps, loads, stores, and so many other functions for our ALU.</description>
