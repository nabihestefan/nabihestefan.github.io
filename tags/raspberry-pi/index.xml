      <description>For the final Fundamentals of Robotics project, our team (Isabella Abilheira, Chris Allum, Olivia Jo Bradley, Oscar De La Garza,Nabih Estefan, Maya Sivanandan) was tasked with creating a rover that could complete several missions in The O, the center courtyard of Olinâ€™s campus. The three main challenges were: Navigation of unobstructed terrain, Docking in a supply station, and Delivering a payload to a drop box. Besides this, our team decided to try and do 3 extra stretch goals: Navigate through stationary obstacles, park within the medium box of the supply station, and deliver our payload to a specific dropbox using April tags (with a possible one being finding payloads around the O and picking those up for extra deliveries).</description>
