  "description": "Chess has simple rules, but the game space is extremely large. With the strength of our current computers, we aren't even close to solving the game of chess by brute force. As a fallback, engines use a heuristic to try to find the best moves for a given player, which basically traverses a 'game tree' (tree of possible moves for both players) and quantitatively evaluates the resulting position. This project primarily focuses on how to efficiently traverse such a game tree and create an effective heuristic to maximize the strength of a chess engine. With my partner Andrew Mascillaro, we created a custom chess engine. To test the engine's strength, we have scripts that allow the engine to play agains humans or Stockfish (a top open source chess engine) at different rating levels. Our engine outperformed our expectations, and has won games against the 2400 rated Stockfish engine, which basically means this engine is strong enough to be a titled player in the chess world.",
