Throughout the semester of Computer Architecture we started with Binary logic and built our knowledge up all the way to how different components of a CPU are built from logic gates. This last Lab was centered around me and Oscar De La Garza creating a Single Cycle CPU in Verilog. We built the CPU with branches, jumps, loads, stores, and so many other functions for our ALU.
