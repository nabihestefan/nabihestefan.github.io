Above you can see a perfect pancake flip. At the end of our QEA II class, my project, with Olivia Jo Bradley, was centered around measuring the accelerations and orientations of the pan so that we can compare these (and the frequencies of the accelerations) to a perfect pancake flip, and create animations like the one below. If you want to know how we go from the gif above and the data collected from that movement to the animation below go to our project website.
