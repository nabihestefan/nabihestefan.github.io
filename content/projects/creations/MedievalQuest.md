For the final project for our Software Design class, Oscar De La Garza and I decided to create an Adventure Game in the style of the original _The Legend Of Zelda_. We created this game using Python's PyGame library, developing different enemies, characters, screens, and mechanics that are used on different goals throughout the game. You can see in more detail the Sprites and mechanics we developed for _Medieval Quest_ in our project webpage below.
