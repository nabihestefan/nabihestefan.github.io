Throughout the semester in out Computer Architecture class, we learned how different logic gates are used to create different components of a CPU, eventually leading up to us building a full Single-Cycle CPU (which you can see in another project). For our final project, Oscar De La Garza and I decided to recreate one of these very important components from a CPU in a different platform than the ones we had used previously: Minecraft. To see the details of how this 8-bit ALU in Minecraft works, and what steps we did to build, test, and compare it for effectiveness, you can go to the Project Website.
