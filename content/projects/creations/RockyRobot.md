For the final project of Engineering Systems Analysis (ESA) I programmed (with Olivia Jo Bradley) a Balboa U324 robot (which we called Rocky) to self-balance. This project was centered mostly around the logic and calculations behind transfer functions, and how these can be used for feedback loops with PI control, simulating the robot as an inverted pendulum, and having Rocky react to changes in its position to stabilize.
