      <description>For the final project of Engineering Systems Analysis (ESA) I programmed (with Olivia Jo Bradley) a Balboa U324 robot (which we called Rocky) to self-balance. This project was centered mostly around the logic and calculations behind transfer functions, and how these can be used for feedback loops with PI control, simulating the robot as an inverted pendulum, and having Rocky react to changes in its position to stabilize.</description>

      <title>Dum-E: a 2x2x2 Rubik&#39;s Cube Solver</title>

      <description>Olivia Jo Bradley, Maya Sivanandan, Florian Schwarzinger, and I participated in the MakeHarvard 2020 Make-a-thon. We decided to create, in our 24 hours, an automatic 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube solver. The difference between this and a normal Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube solver is the fact that a 2x2x2 Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube cant be held by the center pieces to turn the sides of the cube the way normal cubes are held, meaning it has to be free to twist and turn during it being solved.</description>
